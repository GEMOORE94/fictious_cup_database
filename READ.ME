A project inspired by current research into diagnostic problems related to Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP)
Produced for the completion of the '[Data & SQL](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/courses/classes/career-switcher/)' course run by Code First Girls.  

 The aim of the project was to create a fictious database which would store related information to attempts at diagnosis confirmation in a hospital setting.
 The project also aimed to incorporate the dummy dataset taken from https://github.com/mahmoodlab from which the basis of their Machine Learning algorithm had been
 trained, "Our model is trained on 22,833 gigapixel diagnostic whole slide images (WSIs) from 18 different primary cancer origins and tested on an held-out set of 
 6,499 (WSIs) and an external set of 682 WSIs from 200+ institutions." 
 
 However, this has not worked as well as I would like and so this remains FUNDAMENTALLY in draft form as I keep learning to use MySQL.
